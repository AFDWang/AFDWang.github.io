  Graph neural networks (GNNs) are gaining attention, but performing efficient large GNN training over GPUs remains a challenge. This work proposes a high-performance GNN training framework for multi-GPUs. We explore different GNN partition strategies for multi-GPUs, and investigate the influence of different graph ordering patterns on the GPU performance during the calculation process of GNNs. Moreover, block-sparsity-aware optimization methods are put forward for GPU memory access. The experiments on four large-scale GNN datasets demonstrate the efficiency of our framework compared to existing system such as DGL.
