abstract: >-
  Multi-task (MT) multi-modal (MM) models pose significant challenges due to the sophisticated model architecture and the heterogeneous workloads of different ML tasks and data modalities. We propose Spindle, a new training system tailored for resource-efficient and high-performance training of MT MM models via wavefront scheduling. The key idea of Spindle is to decompose the MT MM model execution into waves and address the joint optimization problem sequentially, including both heterogeneity-aware workload parallelization and dependency-driven execution scheduling.
