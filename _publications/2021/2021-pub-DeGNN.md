  Graph convolutional networks (GCNs) are key in graph mining but face challenges such as diverse performance across applications, oversmoothing, and non-robustness. This paper introduces DeGNN, a graph decomposition approach to improve GCN performance. We propose an automatic, connectivity-aware decomposition algorithm and provide a theoretical explanation from an information-theoretic perspective. We show that graph decomposition can reduce information loss in deeper GCNs, mitigating the exponential convergence of mutual information.
