    <strong>Education</strong> <br/> 
    I am a Ph.D. student in the School of Computer Science at <a href="https://english.pku.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Peking University (PKU)</a>, 
    where I have been studying since 2021 under the guidance of <a href="https://cuibinpku.github.io/" target="_blank">Prof. Bin Cui</a>.
    I received my Bachelor's degree from Peking University in 2021.
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Research Interest</strong> <br/> 
    My research interest primarily lies in <strong>Distributed Deep/Machine Learning Systems (DL/MLSys), Infrastructure for Large Language Models (LLM Infra)</strong>.
    In recent years, I mainly focus on: 
    (1) Parallelism optimization for LLMs training; 
    (2) Efficient long-context training; 
    (3) Multi-task, multi-modality training acceleration; 
    (4) Memory management and communication optimization in distributed systems.
    Currently, I am also interested in: 
    (1) Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) Models training and inference optimization; 
    (2) Post-training and reinforcement learning systems (RL Infra); 
    (3) Diffusion models training and inference optimization.    
  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Publications</strong> <br/> 
    I have published 10 papers in top-tier CCF-A conferences and journals (4 first-authored papers and 2 second-authored papers), including ASPLOS, VLDB, SIGMOD, SOSP, TKDE, ICLR, ICCV, SIGKDD, and etc.
    I also have 2 recent papers under review.

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>System Projects</strong> <br/> 
    I am the designer, project leader, and main developer of <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/Hetu-Galvatron" target="_blank">Hetu-Galvatron</a>, 
    an open-source automatic parallel training system optimized for LLMs. 
    I am also a core developer of <a href="https://github.com/PKU-DAIR/Hetu" target="_blank">Hetu</a>, a high-performance distributed deep learning system.

  </p>
  <p>
    <strong>Industrial Applications</strong> <br/>
    My works and systems have been applied in billion-scale industrial applications, such as accelerating the training of LLMs with over 100B parameters, 
    and has been utilized by companies like HUAWEI, ZTE, Alibaba, and etc. 
    Currently, I am also collaborating with more industrial companies to deploy and further develop these systems, such as ByteDance and Baidu.
